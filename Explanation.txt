The Vehicle Parking Management System Database is like the brain behind making sure our parking lots run smoothly. It uses different tables to keep track of everything. Let's break it down:

1. Parking Lots Table:
   - What it does: Holds information about each parking lot.
   - Why it's important: Helps us know details like the lot name and how many vehicles it can hold.

2. Vehicles Table:
   - What it does: Keeps tabs on all the vehicles parked.
   - Why it's important: Stores info like the vehicle's plate number and type.

3. Parking Logs Table:
   - What it does: Records every time a vehicle enters or exits a parking lot.
   - Why it's important: Helps in tracking the flow of vehicles and managing parking activities.

4. Users Table:
   - What it does: Manages user information, like administrators or regular users.
   - Why it's important: Ensures secure access to the system and associates parking activities with users.

5. Parking Rates Table:

   - Why it's important: Helps in calculating charges based on the time a vehicle spends in a lot.

How It Works:
   - Each parking lot has its own set of vehicles and specific rates.

   - The database is flexible and can adapt to future enhancements, making it ready for smart parking solutions.

In a nutshell, the Vehicle Parking Management System Database is like the organizer making sure our parking lots are well-managed, secure, and ready for future advancements.
